# Subscription Synchronization Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem Solved

**Issue:** Users completing Stripe checkout were being redirected to the app before the webhook processed, causing them to see "Boyfriend Mode" (free tier) instead of "Player Mode" (paid tier). This race condition meant users had to manually refresh to see their upgraded status.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Verification Edge Function ✅

**Created:** `supabase/functions/verify-subscription/index.ts`

**Purpose:** Provides authoritative subscription status by checking Stripe API directly, not relying solely on webhook updates.

**How it works:**
- Accepts `session_id` from Stripe checkout redirect
- Fetches checkout session from Stripe API
- Retrieves subscription details directly from Stripe
- Updates database if subscription exists but isn't synced
- Returns current subscription status

**Key benefit:** Even if webhook is delayed or fails, this endpoint ensures database is up-to-date.

---

### 2. Smart Polling on Success Page ✅

**Updated:** `src/pages/SubscriptionSuccessPage.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Calls `verify-subscription` endpoint when page loads
- Implements polling: checks every 2 seconds (max 10 attempts = 20 seconds)
- Shows meaningful loading states:
  - "Activating Your Subscription" during verification
  - "Processing Your Subscription" if timeout reached
- Provides "Retry" button if verification fails
- Refreshes user profile once verified

**User Experience:**
- **Before:** User saw old tier, had to refresh manually
- **After:** User sees loading indicator, then success automatically within seconds

---

### 3. Real-Time Profile Updates ✅

**Updated:** `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`

**Added:** Database change listener using Supabase Realtime

**How it works:**
- Subscribes to `users` table updates for current user
- When webhook updates subscription_tier → profile refreshes automatically
- User sees tier change in real-time without page refresh

**Benefits:**
- Webhook updates are instantly reflected in UI
- Works across multiple browser tabs
- No polling needed after initial verification

---

### 4. Fixed Type Definitions ✅

**Updated:** `src/lib/types/database.ts`

**Changes:**
- Added `'boyfriend' | 'player'` to subscription_tier types
- Added `subscription_plan_type: 'weekly' | 'annual' | null`
- Added `subscription_period_start` and `subscription_period_end`
- Added `has_seen_paywall: boolean`

**Impact:** Eliminates TypeScript errors and ensures type safety.

## How It Works Now

### Complete Flow

```
1. User completes Stripe checkout
   ↓
2. Stripe redirects to: /?page=subscription-success&session_id=XXX
   ↓
3. SubscriptionSuccessPage loads and shows "Activating..."
   ↓
4. Calls verify-subscription endpoint
   ↓
5. Endpoint checks Stripe API directly:
   - If subscription active → Updates database
   - Returns subscription status
   ↓
6. If not ready yet, polls every 2 seconds (max 20s)
   ↓
7. Once verified:
   - Shows success message
   - Refreshes user profile
   - User sees "Player Mode" immediately
   ↓
8. Background: Webhook also fires (usually within 2-5 seconds)
   ↓
9. Real-time listener detects webhook's database update
   ↓
10. Profile refreshes automatically (if user still on page)
```

### Why This Solves the Problem

**Before:**
- Webhook was the ONLY way to update subscription
- Webhook fires 2-10 seconds after redirect
- User saw old tier until manual refresh

**After:**
- Verification endpoint checks Stripe immediately
- Updates database proactively
- Webhook serves as backup/confirmation
- Real-time listener catches webhook updates
- User never sees stale data

## Testing the Fix

### For Current Stuck User

**Immediate Solution:**
```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor
UPDATE users
SET
  subscription_tier = 'player',
  subscription_status = 'active',
  subscription_plan_type = 'weekly'  -- or 'annual'
WHERE email = 'USER_EMAIL';
```

User should refresh page and see "Player Mode" with ability to add 50 profiles.

### Testing New Checkout Flow

1. **Deploy the new Edge Function:**
   ```bash
   # The verify-subscription function needs to be deployed
   # This is done via the Supabase MCP tools
   ```

2. **Test with test card:**
   - Sign in or create new account
   - Click "Activate Player Mode"
   - Use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - Complete checkout
   - **Verify:** Should see loading spinner, then success within 5 seconds
   - **Verify:** Can immediately add multiple profiles
   - **Verify:** Settings shows "Player Mode"

3. **Test webhook delay scenario:**
   - Temporarily disable webhook in Stripe Dashboard
   - Complete checkout
   - **Verify:** Still works! (verification endpoint handles it)
   - Re-enable webhook
   - **Verify:** Real-time listener picks up webhook update

4. **Test real-time updates:**
   - Open app in browser
   - In Supabase SQL Editor, manually change subscription_tier
   - **Verify:** UI updates automatically without refresh
   - Check console for "Profile updated" message

## Deployment Checklist

### Before Deploying

- [x] Created verify-subscription Edge Function
- [x] Updated SubscriptionSuccessPage with polling
- [x] Added real-time listener to AuthContext
- [x] Fixed database type definitions
- [x] Project builds successfully

### To Deploy

- [ ] Deploy verify-subscription Edge Function to Supabase
- [ ] Verify Stripe webhook is properly configured
- [ ] Test with real Stripe checkout (test mode)
- [ ] Monitor Edge Function logs for errors
- [ ] Check for any stuck users after 24 hours

### Verification Commands

**Check function deployed:**
```bash
# Should show verify-subscription in the list
supabase functions list
```

**Check webhook configuration:**
- Stripe Dashboard → Developers → Webhooks
- Endpoint: `https://YOUR_PROJECT.supabase.co/functions/v1/stripe-webhook`
- Events: Must include `checkout.session.completed`

**Monitor for stuck users:**
```sql
-- Run this daily for first week
SELECT
  email,
  subscription_tier,
  stripe_subscription_id,
  created_at
FROM users
WHERE stripe_customer_id IS NOT NULL
  AND subscription_tier = 'boyfriend'
  AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

If any results, investigate and manually fix.

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Success Metrics

**Target:**
- 99% of users see correct tier within 5 seconds of checkout
- <1% require manual intervention
- Zero stuck users after 24 hours

**How to measure:**
1. Monitor verify-subscription Edge Function logs
2. Check for errors or timeouts
3. Run stuck user query daily
4. Review support tickets for subscription issues

### Common Issues & Fixes

**Issue 1: Verification endpoint times out**
- Check Stripe API key is valid
- Verify SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY is set
- Check Edge Function logs for errors

**Issue 2: Real-time updates not working**
- Verify Realtime is enabled in project settings
- Check RLS policies allow user to read own row
- Look for console errors in browser

**Issue 3: Webhook still not firing**
- Check webhook configuration in Stripe
- Verify signing secret in Supabase environment
- Test webhook delivery in Stripe Dashboard

### Rollback Plan

If severe issues occur:

1. **Disable verify-subscription calls:**
   - Comment out verification logic in SuccessPage
   - Fall back to webhook-only flow
   - Users will need to refresh manually (old behavior)

2. **Fix the issue**

3. **Re-enable gradually:**
   - Test thoroughly
   - Monitor logs
   - Enable for all users

The webhook still functions independently, so this is purely additive.

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy verify-subscription Edge Function** - Critical for fix to work
2. **Test complete flow** - Use test card to verify end-to-end
3. **Fix current stuck user** - Run manual SQL update
4. **Monitor for 48 hours** - Check logs and stuck user query
5. **Adjust polling if needed** - May increase/decrease based on webhook speed

---

## Technical Details

### Why Polling?

Webhook arrival time is unpredictable (2-10 seconds typically, but can be longer). Polling ensures we check frequently until subscription is confirmed, providing the best user experience.

**Polling strategy:**
- Interval: 2 seconds (not too aggressive, not too slow)
- Max attempts: 10 (20 seconds total)
- After timeout: Show "processing" message with retry button

### Why Real-Time Listener?

Even with verification, webhook serves as authoritative source. Real-time listener ensures:
- UI stays in sync with database
- Updates happen automatically across tabs/sessions
- No need for manual refresh
- Webhook confirmations are immediately visible

### Error Handling

All three mechanisms provide fallbacks:
1. **Verification endpoint** - Immediate check, updates if needed
2. **Polling** - Retries if initial check pending
3. **Real-time listener** - Catches late webhook updates
4. **Manual retry** - User can trigger re-verification

---

## Success Criteria

Fix is successful when:

- [x] Code builds without errors
- [ ] verify-subscription deploys successfully
- [ ] Test checkout completes with automatic upgrade
- [ ] User sees correct tier within 5 seconds
- [ ] No manual refresh needed
- [ ] Webhook still processes correctly
- [ ] Real-time updates work across tabs
- [ ] Zero stuck users after 24 hours

---

## Conclusion

This fix addresses the root cause (webhook race condition) by implementing proactive verification with Stripe API, while maintaining webhook as backup. The addition of real-time listeners ensures users always see current subscription status.

The solution is:
- **Reliable:** Multiple fallback mechanisms
- **Fast:** Verification happens in seconds
- **User-friendly:** Clear loading states and error messages
- **Maintainable:** Well-documented and testable
- **Safe:** Doesn't break existing webhook flow

For the current stuck user, a simple database update will immediately resolve their issue, and the new system will prevent this from happening to future users.
