# Subscription System Implementation

Your subscription system has been successfully implemented! Here's everything you need to know:

## 🎯 Overview

The app now has a two-tier subscription system:
- **Boyfriend Mode** (Free): Limited to 1 active profile
- **Player Mode** (Paid): Unlimited profiles + all premium features
  - Weekly: $1.99/week
  - Annual: $27/year (Save 74%)

## 🔧 Setup Required

### 1. Stripe Configuration

You need to add your Stripe credentials to the `.env` file:

```env
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_actual_stripe_publishable_key
VITE_STRIPE_PRICE_PLAYER_MODE_WEEKLY=price_id_for_weekly_plan
VITE_STRIPE_PRICE_PLAYER_MODE_ANNUAL=price_id_for_annual_plan
```

**Where to get these:**
1. Log in to your [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com)
2. Go to Developers > API Keys to get your publishable key
3. Go to Products > Create two products:
   - "Player Mode Weekly" at $1.99/week (recurring)
   - "Player Mode Annual" at $27/year (recurring)
4. Copy the Price IDs from each product

### 2. Stripe Webhook Configuration

The webhook handler is already deployed as a Supabase Edge Function. You need to:

1. Go to Stripe Dashboard > Developers > Webhooks
2. Click "Add endpoint"
3. Enter webhook URL: `https://0ec90b57d6e95fcbda19832f.supabase.co/functions/v1/stripe-webhook`
4. Select these events to listen for:
   - `checkout.session.completed`
   - `customer.subscription.updated`
   - `customer.subscription.deleted`
   - `invoice.payment_failed`
5. Copy the webhook signing secret and add it to your Supabase Edge Function secrets

**Note:** The Supabase environment already has STRIPE_SECRET_KEY configured. If you need to update it, contact your Supabase admin.

## 🚀 Testing the Flow

### Test User Journey:
1. **New User Signs Up** → Signs In → **Paywall appears**
2. **Selects Boyfriend Mode** → Enters app with 1 profile limit
3. **Tries to access Analytics** → Page is blurred with upgrade modal

5. **Completes payment** → Redirected to success page
6. **Success page** → Shows confirmation → Auto-redirects to dashboard
7. **Dashboard** → All features now unlocked

## 🔒 Security Notes

- All Stripe operations happen server-side via Edge Functions
- Webhook signature verification ensures authenticity
- RLS policies protect user data
- Customer IDs are securely stored and linked to user accounts

## 📱 Mobile Responsive

All subscription modals and pages are fully responsive and work on mobile devices.

## 💡 Next Steps

1. **Add Stripe credentials** to `.env` file
2. **Create Stripe products** for weekly and annual plans
3. **Configure webhook** in Stripe Dashboard
4. **Test the flow** with Stripe test mode
5. **Switch to production** when ready by updating keys

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- The `.env` file currently has placeholder values - replace them with real Stripe keys
- Stripe is in test mode by default - remember to switch to live mode for production
- The billing portal URL in Settings needs to be updated with your actual Stripe portal link
- All Edge Functions are already deployed and configured

## 🎉 You're All Set!

Once you've added your Stripe credentials, the subscription system is ready to go. Users can now sign up, choose their plan, and start using the app with the appropriate restrictions and features!
